Conversions to streams/followers usually come within 7-14 days. For significant and lasting impact, allow 1-3 months of continuous optimization. Our campaigns constantly improve thanks to AI and real-time performance analysis. We recommend minimum 30-day campaigns, as algorithms need 7 to 10 days of learning."
